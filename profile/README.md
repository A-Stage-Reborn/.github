# A Stage Reborn™
## Making Arts More Accessible
Our mission at A Stage Reborn™ is making arts more accessible. 

We believe in the transformative power of the arts. Through our 
various projects and initiatives, we strive to bridge gaps in 
accessibility and provide platforms for diverse voices in the 
creative community.

We're a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit with a global reach. We make 
arts more accessible through innovative digital mediums, community 
engagement, and creative educational opportunities. Since 2015, 
we've been empowering artists of all backgrounds and helping 
communities connect through the power of performance and creativity.

We were founded on October 31, 2015 and earned our charitable status 
on June 23, 2017. We're incorporated in Nebraska and Washington states.
